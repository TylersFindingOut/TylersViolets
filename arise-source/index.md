# Tyler's Violets

Welcome to Tyler's Violets, your one stop place if your looking for a eccentric Cybersecurity expert.

Check out my [YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/@Tyler_Parsons)

## Its a WIP

This entire site is currently a work in progress project meant to be a portfolio showing off my skills, its nowhere near done yet.

## Blackwell coming soon!

One of the things I'm proud of is my exploits, I have an airgapped computer that I keep most of my dangerous exploits on, I've dubbed it the Blackwell.

I plan on adding a public facing Blackwell with some example exploits, but everything is a WIP so stay tuned for that.

## Testing zone

This is the area I'm using to test links to other pages and such while I work on the site, you can ignore everything past this point.

This should link to a new page, [ANOTHERPAGE](posts) on this website.
